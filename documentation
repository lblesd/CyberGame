# CyberGuard Academy - Complete Framework Documentation

## High-Level Gameplay Structure

### Phase 1: Risk Assessment (NIST "Identify")
**Duration**: 5-10 minutes
**Objective**: Establish baseline security posture

```
START → Risk Assessment Questionnaire → Security Level Calculation → Scenario Generation
```

**Assessment Categories:**
1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - None (0 points) → High vulnerability to credential theft
   - Admin only (1 point) → Moderate risk from staff accounts
   - All users (2 points) → Strong credential protection

2. **Backup Strategy**
   - No backups (0 points) → Complete data loss risk
   - Network backups (1 point) → Ransomware vulnerability
   - Air-gapped (2 points) → Rapid recovery capability

3. **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)**
   - Basic antivirus (0 points) → Limited threat detection
   - Advanced AV (1 point) → Some behavioral analysis
   - Full EDR (2 points) → Comprehensive monitoring

4. **Staff Training**
   - None (0 points) → High human error risk
   - Annual training (1 point) → Basic awareness
   - Regular + simulations (2 points) → Strong security culture

5. **Incident Response Plan**
   - No plan (0 points) → Chaotic response
   - Written plan (1 point) → Structured but untested
   - Tested plan (2 points) → Proven effectiveness

### Phase 2: Incident Simulation (NIST "Protect", "Detect", "Respond")
**Duration**: 15-25 minutes
**Objective**: Navigate realistic cyber incidents

```
Scenario 1 → Decision → Consequences → Cost Calculation → Next Scenario
```

### Phase 3: Recovery & Results (NIST "Recover")
**Duration**: 5 minutes
**Objective**: Assess performance and provide learning outcomes

    let scenarios = [];
    
    // Always include core scenarios
    scenarios.push(...coreScenarios);
    
    // Add conditional scenarios based on weaknesses
    if (assessment.mfa < 2) scenarios.push(credentialTheftScenario);
    if (assessment.backup < 2) scenarios.push(ransomwareScenario);
    if (assessment.training < 1) scenarios.push(socialEngScenario);
    
    // Adjust difficulty
    scenarios.forEach(scenario => {
        scenario.decisions.forEach(decision => {
            if (securityLevel === 'Weak') {
                decision.cost *= 1.5;
                decision.hours *= 1.3;
            } else if (securityLevel === 'Strong') {
                decision.cost *= 0.8;
                decision.hours *= 0.9;
